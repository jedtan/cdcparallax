00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm Farouk Dey, the
Associate Vice Provost

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.390 align:middle line:84%
for Student Affairs and Dean of
Career Education at Stanford.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.798 align:middle line:90%
Nice to meet you, Farouk.

00:00:08.798 --> 00:00:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you can tell us a
little bit about Vision 20/20.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Vision 20/20 is
Stanford's attempt

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.034 align:middle line:84%
to reinvent career services for
university students and alumni.

00:00:21.034 --> 00:00:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Do you want me to go more?

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.030 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.159 align:middle line:90%
Good to back it off or--

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:26.664 align:middle line:90%

00:00:26.664 --> 00:00:28.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle line:84%
We are pushing the boundaries
of what a university career

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:84%
education program can do
for its students and alumni

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:90%
at Stanford.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.540 align:middle line:84%
We are doing this by embedding
our career coaches and career

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:90%
communities all over campus.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:84%
We are connecting
our career catalysts

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:84%
with alumni and corporate
partners all over the world.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And we are connecting our career
ventures team with industries

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.560 align:middle line:84%
all for the purpose
of bring in more

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:90%
opportunities for our students.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:84%
We are committed to
helping students transition

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.490 align:middle line:84%
successfully into
the world of work.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And we have set up an
exciting and bold vision.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Stanford's vision for career
education is for all students

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.110 align:middle line:84%
to transform their
education and ambitions

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.700 align:middle line:84%
into meaningful work over
the course of their lifetime.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Stanford's model of
career connections

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
rely on the concept
of meaningful work

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:90%
because it's different.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not about just
helping students get jobs.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.680 align:middle line:84%
It's about positioning
students to obtain

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:84%
the type of work that adds value
and meaning to their own lives.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.620 align:middle line:84%
At Stanford University
we talk about creating

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.710 align:middle line:84%
a culture of happenstance where
we're often putting students

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:84%
in the right place at
the right time in front

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:84%
of the right person who opens
the right door for them.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So our entire programming
for our students

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:84%
is designed with that in mind
to create these types of moments

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:84%
where they can be engaged
with the person who can

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.740 align:middle line:90%
create an opportunity for them.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:84%
It's these types of
connections that we

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:84%
want to establish for all of
our students all the time.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Vision 20/20 at
Stanford is about taking

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
all of these opportunities
and career connections

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to where the students are rather
than waiting for the students

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:90%
to come to us.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.777 align:middle line:90%
