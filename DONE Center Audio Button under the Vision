Mission photo in background li'd like for it to resize like the home page graphic. and then just have the text below the image. Is that possible? Refer to mobile mockup for reference. I'll be working on this too, but it's not actually super easy so this will take me a while as well. 
There's a white gap between Mission and Model that we want to get rid of. The grey background of the model should connect with Mission. 
Pop ups are working pretty well! Can you make the pop up bubbles less wide? Refer to my mockup. Also, we need white text, and not justified, just left aligned. Are you still able to make the sections blink? 
The Stanford Career Education logo looks distorted, like it's squished a bit. Can you double check that?  

Video needs to be full width.  This is partially a youtube issue. I think life would be easier using html video with this regard.

Pop ups creates a large right margin. There's probably no way to fix that huh? I'll look into a way
