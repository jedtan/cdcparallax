Vertica vs. Couchbase

Both Vertica and Couchbase seem very fast for ID lookups (i.e. get a single record with a specific ID). 
Vertica undoubtedly works better than Couchbase when the two are unindexed.

Example Queries
Couchbase: ~3 million records
Vertica: ~40 million records (with 600 million record join table)
